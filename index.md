**[日本語ページはこちら (Japanese)](/ja/)**

Hello! I am **Kurorekishi**, an **Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer** and **Technical Artist** based in Osaka, Japan. I specialize in bridging the gap between engineering and art, developing robust editor tools, and creating visually striking procedural content using **C++, UE5, HLSL, and Python**.

With a strong focus on **asset management, workflow optimization**, and **tool development**, I strive to create environments where artists can work efficiently and creativity can flourish.

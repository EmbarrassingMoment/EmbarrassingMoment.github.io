**[日本語ページはこちら (Japanese)](/ja/)**

Hello! I am **Kurorekishi**, an **Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer** and **Technical Artist** based in Osaka, Japan. I specialize in bridging the gap between engineering and art, developing robust editor tools, and creating visually striking procedural content using **C++, UE5, HLSL, and Python**.

With a strong focus on **asset management, workflow optimization**, and **tool development**, I strive to create environments where artists can work efficiently and creativity can flourish.

## Technical Skills
- **Game Engines:** Unreal Engine 5 (C++, HLSL), Cocos Creator 3.8 (TypeScript)
- **Languages:** C++, TypeScript, Java, Objective-C, HLSL, Python
- **Tools:** Jenkins (CI/CD), Git, Backlog, Node.js
- **Specialties:** Editor Tool Development, Procedural Material, Technical Art, Team Leadership

## Work Experience Highlights
- Lead Programmer (7 engineers, 25-person team)
- CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (Jenkins, build optimization)
- Artist/Planner Coordination & Workflow Optimization
- Junior Developer Training (2 developers, 3-month program)

## Projects

### 1. [MIRenamer](https://github.com/EmbarrassingMoment/MIRenamer)
**UE5 Plugin / Workflow Automation**

A powerful plugin for automating the naming of Material Instance assets with intelligent pattern recognition and customizable prefixes.
*   **Key Features:** Batch renaming, auto-rename on creation, command-line support (Commandlet), and multi-language UI (English/Japanese).
*   **Technical Highlights:** Context menu integration, asset registry scanning, intelligent base name extraction from multiple naming patterns, and CI/CD pipeline support.
*   **Distribution:** Available on [Fab](https://www.fab.com/listings/0523dde6-2cc5-4129-9d83-78584910d5a5).

### 2. [ProceduralDrawingMaterialSamples](https://github.com/EmbarrassingMoment/ProceduralDrawingMaterialSamples)
**UE5 Sample Project / Technical Art**

A collection of textureless procedural material samples demonstrating advanced shader techniques.
*   **Key Features:** Includes diverse effects such as radar, animations, snowflakes, and transitions.
*   **Community:** Highly regarded with 139+ stars and 12+ forks on GitHub.
*   **License:** MIT License.

### 3. [TextureChannelPacker (RGBPackingTool)](https://github.com/EmbarrassingMoment/RGBPackingTool)
**UE5 Plugin / Asset Optimization**

A high-performance utility for packing grayscale textures into RGBA channels, essential for optimizing game assets and creating industry-standard texture maps.
*   **Key Features:** Creates ORM/ORD maps, supports 16-bit/32-bit float textures, automatic resizing with high-quality bilinear interpolation, and multi-language UI (English/Japanese).
*   **Technical Highlights:** Multi-threaded parallel processing for fast conversion, extended format support (G8, G16, R16F, R32F, RGBA32F), cancellable progress dialog, and intelligent default handling (black for RGB, white for Alpha).
*   **Distribution:** Available on [Fab](https://www.fab.com/listings/7b231ecc-079f-45dc-9b8e-45dacc6b0771).
*   **License:** MIT License.

### 4. [QuickBaker](https://github.com/EmbarrassingMoment/QuickBaker)
**UE5 Plugin / Material Baking**

A lightweight editor tool designed to streamline the conversion of dynamic material expressions into static textures. It enables efficient baking of procedural noise, Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), and LUTs directly within the engine.
*   **Key Features:** Supports direct-to-asset baking (.uasset) and disk export (PNG/EXR), high-precision 16-bit float output, and workflow optimizations such as auto-naming and directory management.
*   **License:** MIT License.
*   **Distribution:** Available on [Fab](https://www.fab.com/listings/b53f5488-9b96-43cd-9963-e9fedafb56e9).
